Library Management System (Python + Tkinter)

This is a simple GUI-based Library Management System built using Python, Tkinter, and OOP principles. 
It allows users to manage books, members, and borrowing/returning operations in an easy-to-use graphical interface.

Features:
- View list of available books
- Add new books to the library
- Search books by title
- Register new library members
- Borrow and return books
- Automatically updates book stock
- Member records are saved in 'members.txt' for persistence

Project Structure:
- Book Class: Stores book details and manages stock updates
- Member Class: Stores member information and tracks borrowed books
- Library Class: Central data manager for books and members
- LibraryGUI Class: Handles the graphical user interface using Tkinter
- members.txt: Stores registered members for future use

Data Persistence:
- Book information is stored in runtime only.
- Member information is stored permanently in 'members.txt' so members remain registered after closing the program.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- pillow library (pip install pillow)
- requests library (pip install requests)

How to Run:
1. Save the code to a file, for example: library.py
2. Run the script:
   python library.py

GUI Design:
- The interface uses a background image from the internet.
- Left panel contains menu options.
- Right panel displays selected operations.

Note:
- Internet connection is required the first time to load the background image.
- Ensure 'members.txt' is in the same folder (it will be created automatically if missing).
