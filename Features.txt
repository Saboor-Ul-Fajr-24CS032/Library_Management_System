A simple Library Management System built in Python that uses classes (Book, Member, and Library) to organize book details, member records, and book transactions efficiently. 
It ensures smooth library operations like adding, borrowing, and returning books.

⚙️ Features:
Add and View Books: Add new books with auto-generated unique IDs and view all available books.
Search Books: Find books easily using keywords from their titles.
Member Registration: Register new members and store their data in a text file (members.txt).
Borrow & Return Books: Members can borrow available books and return them after reading.
File Handling: Saves member records persistently between program runs.
Error Handling: Prevents invalid inputs and duplicate member entries.

Classes Overview:
Book → Handles book details, availability, and stock updates.
Member → Manages member information and borrowed books.
Library → Controls the entire system, connecting books and members with operations like borrowing, returning, and searching.

How to Run:
Save the file as library_management.py.
Make sure members.txt exists (it will auto-create if not).
Run using:
python library_management.py
Follow the on-screen menu to perform actions.

File Created:
